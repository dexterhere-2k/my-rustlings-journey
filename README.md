### My Rustlings Journey 
This repository contains my solutions to the Rustlings exercises. Rustlings is a collection of small exercises to get used to reading and writing Rust code, focusing heavily on responding to compiler messages and fixing broken code.

I am using this project to build a deep understanding of Rust’s unique memory management and type system.

### 📚 Resources Used
[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - The official "Book" for deep conceptual dives.

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) - For quick syntax references and code samples.
